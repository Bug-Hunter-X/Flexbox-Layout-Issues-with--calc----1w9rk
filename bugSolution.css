Instead of directly subtracting pixels from 100% within the `calc()` function, it is often better to use flex-grow, flex-shrink, or explicit width/height values to manage the space more predictably.  Adjust margins or padding on parent or child elements as needed. The `calc()` function can still be used, but in a way where it interacts seamlessly with flexbox principles.  Consider the context of the flexbox container and the element the `calc()` is applied to.
