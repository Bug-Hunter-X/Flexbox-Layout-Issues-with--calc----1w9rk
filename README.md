This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function when used within flexbox layouts. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version. The problem arises from how `calc()` interacts with flexbox's sizing algorithm. The solution often involves adjusting the approach to account for the inherent properties of flexbox sizing or using alternative methods.
